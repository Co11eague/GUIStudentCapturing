# GUIStudentCapturing

This is a GUI application based on the idea of a student capturing system. A student can be added to the system when a studentId, year of study and the allocation of 3 module choices is entered. The system also ensures that some editing can take place; as well as the deletion of a student from the system.

This program was done in Java when I was learning full stack application development. It uses JavaFX for the GUI.
